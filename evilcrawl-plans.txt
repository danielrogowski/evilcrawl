===================
items for evilcrawl
===================

- option to extend beyond level 27 (port from spicy)

- make DS guarantee of Hurl Hellfire and Death Affinity optional

- write README

- post in the dcss forums about this fork and the VP implementation

- remain in sync with new tags of vanilla

(- changes to VP are non-optional, since the vanilla implementations are, well, dull)

======================

======================

- food.cc: chunks before other food
- timed-effects.cc: _handle_magic_contamination: ifs are arranged strangely with the orb influencing dissipation
